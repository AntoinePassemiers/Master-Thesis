\section{Summary of input features}

  As described in section \ref{inputfeatures}, input features can be split into three categories:
  global, 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional features.
  The proposed model takes as input the protein length, the effective number of sequences
  in the corresponding MSA, position-specific statistics,
  residue pair-specific statistics, and predictions made by PSICOV, plmDCA and GaussDCA.
  Additionaly to these features, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and
  region disorder are predicted by RaptorX-property server and added to the rest of
  1-dimensional features.
