\section{Datasets}

  Five datasets have been used in the framework of this thesis:
  one for training the model, one for optimizing the hyper-parameters, and three for benchmarking.
  The training set is a set of 354 proteins including the 150 families reported in the original PSICOV
  paper~\cite{doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr638}, plus a subset of the first benchmark set used by
  Michel et al. to evaluate PConsC3~\cite{Skwark079673}.
  The validation set is composed of the 30 protein families from the validation set of PConsC3,
  which itself is a subset of the test set of PConsC2~\cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003889}.

  Three test sets have also been considered in order to make a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art RaptorX-Contact predictor.
  The first test set embodies the 105 protein domains from the CASP11 experiment, the second test set 76 proteins from the CAMEO
  project, and the fourth test set 398 membrane proteins.

  \subsection{Homology reduction}

    A straightforward method for reducing homology between two set of proteins is to
    remove proteins that have a sequence identity rate above a given threshold.
    As a rule of thumb, this threshold is usually set to 40\%.
    Identity rates were computed by running Needleman-Wunsch algorithm on each
    pair of proteins coming from two different datasets. Score matrix was set
    such that exact matches give a score of 1 and any mismatch gives a penalty of -1.
    Indeed this approach promotes global alignments with maximum identity rates.

    \begin{table}[H]
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Identity rate & Minimum & Average & Maximum \\
        \hline
        \hline
        Training set - CASP11 & 5.4 & 22.4 & 32.5 \\
        PSICOV150 - CASP11 & 7.3 & 22.9 & 39.7 \\
        PSICOV150 - CAMEO & 6.2 & 21.7 & 34.4 \\
        Training set - CAMEO & 4.0 & 21.3 & 32.5 \\
        PSICOV150 - Membrane & 7.6 & 22.2 & 74.0 \\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \captionof{table}{Identity rates between training and benchmark sets, expressed as percentages.}
      \label{identityrates}
    \end{table}

    Similarity rates are more informative than identity rates because amino acids
    are very likely to mutate across evolution towards amino acids that share
    similar physico-chemical properties, and such measures take these mutations
    into account. However, ECOD H-classes~\cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003926}
    were used instead of similarity rates because they can potentially give more
    evidence on whether two sequences are evolutionary related.
    Therefore, proteins belonging to different datasets and sharing the same
    ECOD H-class have been rejected.

\section{Summary of input features}

  As described in section \ref{inputfeatures}, input features can be split into three categories:
  global, 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional features.
  The proposed model takes as input the protein length, the effective number of sequences
  in the corresponding MSA, position-specific statistics,
  residue pair-specific statistics, and predictions made by PSICOV, plmDCA and GaussDCA.
  Additionaly to these features, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and
  region disorder are predicted by RaptorX-property server and added to the rest of
  1-dimensional features.

\section{Evaluation}

  \subsection{Contact map evaluation}

    Protein contact maps are imbalanced by nature: they contain very few residue contacts compared to their number of residue pairs.
    $L$ being the number of residues in a protein, the number of residue contacts increases linearly with $L$ while the number of residue pairs
    increases quadratically~\cite{OLMEA1997S25}. This is important because one can evaluate a model only on the $L$ (or even less than $L$) predicted
    residue contacts the model is the most confident about. Such evaluation metric is called \textit{best-L/k PPV (Positive Predictive Value)}
    and can be formulated as follows:

    \begin{equation}
      \text{Best-L/k PPV} = \frac{\sum_{\underset {i-j \geq 6}{(i, j) \in B(L/k)}} C_{i, j}}{L/k}
    \end{equation}

    where $C_{i, j}, N_{i, j} \in \{0, 1\} \ \forall i, j, i-j \ge 6$ are boolean values indicating a contact or a non-contact, respectively.  % N_{i,j} does not appear in the formula.
    $B(L/k)$ is the set of $L/k$ most confident predicted probabilities (with highest values) and $p_{i, j}$ is the predicted probability  % Neither does p_{i,j}.
    that residue pair $(i, j)$ forms a contact.
    Contacts under a residue distance of 6 amino acids are not considered during evaludation phase even though they are used during
    training phase.

    Best-L/k PPV can also be split into three separated metrics: short-range, medium-range and long-range contacts.
    These three types of contacts can be defined by the residue separations used by Skwark et al.~\cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003889}:

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Short-range contacts: 6 - 12 residue separation
        \item Medium-range contacts: 12 - 24 residue separation
        \item Long-range contacts: 24+ residue separation
      \end{itemize}

\section{Hyper-parameter optimization}

  In order to ensure the best hyper-parameters are selected for the model that will be evaluated
  on the benchmark sets, the Hyperopt Python library~\cite{Bergstra_2015} has been used to explore
  the hyper-parameter space and fine-tune the model on the validation set.
  Training and evaluating a deep neural network is very costly and, as a matter of fact,
  each trial point in the hyper-parameter space should be carefully selected. Techniques based
  on grid search do not suit the problem because they are uninformed methods.

  Hyperopt provides an informed search method called Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE)~\cite{bergstra2011algorithms}.
  In Bayesian hyper-optimization, the posterior probability $P(\alpha \vert L)$ is defined as a function  % $L$ is confusing: it is the length of sequences just above. Maybe use $\mathcal L$ or $\ell$
  of the hyper-parameter vector $\alpha$ and the loss $L$. Contrary to techniques based on Gaussian processes
  that approximates $P(\alpha \vert L)$ only, TPE models both posterior $P(\alpha \vert L)$ and $P(L)$.
  The prior is iteratively replaced with non-parametric densities based on generated points $\{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dotsc \}$.
  It this search, TPE is an informed search strategy that refines its prior as new points are observed in the
  hyper-parameter space. The "tree structure" is due to the way the posterior is computed.

  \begin{equation}
    P(\alpha \vert L) =
      \begin{cases}
        l(\alpha) &  \text{if} \, L < L^* \\
        g(\alpha) &  \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
  \end{equation}  % l, g and L^* have not been defined yet. And are not clearly defined below.

  Let $f$ be the prediction function of the model (see section \ref{backpropagation} about backpropagation algorithm),
  and let $f(\alpha) \triangleq \text{argmin}_{f(\Theta, \alpha)} c\big(f(\Theta, \alpha)\big)$ be the prediction function  % Formalism: meh
  of a trained model that minimizes a given loss function $c$ w.r.t. a fixed hyper-parameter vector $\alpha$.  % loss function? If denoted by $c$, maybe "cost" function?
  $l(\alpha)$ is the non-parametric density function created by the observations $\{ \alpha^{i} \}$ such that
  $L = c(f(\alpha))$ is below the threshold $L^*$, and $g(\alpha)$ is created with the remaining observations.
  The threshold $L^*$ is set as a quantile of the observed values of $L$.
  The value to be optimized in TPE is the Expected Improvement (EI), which is measured as an infinitesimal sum  % infinitesimal sum? Integral?
  of loss improvements weighted by the posterior. After applying Bayes formule to the posterior, calculus of EI becomes:

  \begin{equation}
    EI_{L^*}(\alpha) = \int_{-\infty}^{L^*} (L^* - L) P(L \vert \alpha) dL
    = \int_{-\infty}^{L^*} (L^* - L) \frac{P(\alpha \vert L) P(L)}{P(\alpha)} dL
  \end{equation}

  In the framework of Adaptive Parzen Estimators, to each hyper-parameter is assigned a prior and a density function,
  and the estimator is built as a weighted mixture of them.
  For example, a continuous variable can be assigned:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A uniform prior with lower bound $a$ and upper bound $b$.
    \item A function defined as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, each centered on a point of the hyper-parameter
    space. The standard deviation of a particular distribution can be set as the maximum between distances to the left and right
    neighbors.
  \end{itemize}

  The density function is either $l(\alpha)$ or $g(\alpha)$ depending on whether the loss function associated to current
  point is below the threshold or not.

  \subsection{Deep learning framework}

    Methods and results presented in this thesis have been both implemented and produced in
    Python. The neural architecture has been built on top of PyTorch,
    which is an open source deep learning framework based on Torch~\cite{torch}.

    PyTorch does not natively handle arbitrary-sized inputs, for example fully-convolutional
    neural networks cannot accept images with variable height/width.
    For this aim, it is necessary to add a layer of abstraction so the neural models are
    able to process \textit{virtual batches} of inputs. Let's define a virtual batch as the number
    of samples a model has to process between each parameter update.
    A forward pass on a virtual batch then consists in constructing one computational graph
    per sample and backpropagate the gradients through each one of them separately.
    Once all the gradients have been computed, they are collected and averaged over the sample
    dimension. Pytorch allows to explicitly call the forward pass, backward pass and update
    procedures when needed, which eases the implementation of virtual batch processing.

    Model general architecture is fully-convolutional, forcing us to use only deep learning
    functionalities that are invariant to individual input sizes. These are:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Element-wise operations like activation functions: ReLU, ELU, Sigmoid, etc.
      \item Dropout, which preserves the dimensionality of its inputs.
      \item Convolution, because convolutional filters have a dimensionality that is
      invariant to the input size (see section \ref{convlayers}).
      \item Batch normalization (see section \ref{batchnorm}).
      \item Many non-neural transformations like arithmetic operations, Einstein
      summation, Kronecker product, etc.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Feature extraction}

    Many features discussed in the present document rely on amino acid counts.
    Despite the fact that counting algorithms such as histograms are embarassingly parallel
    and naturally suitable for multiprocessing, they cannot be efficiently vectorized.
    For this specific reason, the scientific computing library NumPy (which has been extensively
    used during the experiments) is not sufficient to extract this type of features in reasonable
    time. Instead, C extensions have been created using the Cython compiler\cite{behnel2010cython}.

  \subsection{Contact-assisted 3D modelling}

    Contact-assisted 3D modelling algorithm makes use of the Multidimensional scaling algorithm
    as implemented by Scikit-learn~\cite{scikit-learn} and the implementation of Dijkstra's
    algorithm from NetworkX \todo{cite?}.
    Details about the algorithm design are given in appendix.
