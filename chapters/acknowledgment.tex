\noindent I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor Prof. Tom Lenaerts from
the Computer Science Department of Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB),
the Machine Learning Group and the Interuniversity Institute of
Bioinformatics in Brussels ($IB^2$).
He has consistently allowed me to work on everything interested me,
while still driving me back to the subject under discussion in this final
version of the thesis.

\noindent I would also like to thank my co-supervisor Dr. Daniele Raimondi from
the $IB^2$ for all the valuable advice he gave me over the past two years
of master thesis preparation and writing. His expertise in structural
biology and feedback gave me a lot to think about, as well as the opportunity
to come up with a rigorous methodology.

\noindent I would like to thank the Machine Learning Group and $IB^2$ and in particular
Prof. Gianluca Bontempi, as well as Raphaël Leplae from the computing centre
of ULB for giving me access to Hydra (the HPC cluster of VUB/ULB), without
which I would never have been able to produce the results presented in this
document.

\noindent Finally, I would also like to acknowledge my classmate Robin Petit (merci Robin)
for his great support and for the time he invested in proofreading
the thesis when I was halfway through it.
