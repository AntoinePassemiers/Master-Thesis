\section{Dihedral angles prediction}

Dihedral angles prediction is an alternative to contact prediction
for protein structure prediction.

From a general standpoint, a dihedral angle (or torsion angle)
is an angle formed by two planes
along a third one. In chemistry,
the two planes are determined by a group of three atoms each.
A dihedral angle thus involves two groups of three atoms with two shared atoms.

For the specific case of proteins, three types of dihedral angles are defined:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\omega$ - Angle formed by atoms $C_{\alpha}^{(p)}$, $C_{-1}^{(p)}$, $N^{(c)}$ and $C_{\alpha}^{(c)}$
    \item $\phi$ - Angle formed by atoms $C_{-1}^{(p)}$, $N^{(c)}$, $C_{\alpha}^{(c)}$ and $C^{(c)}$
    \item $\psi$ - Angle formed by atoms $N^{(c)}$, $C_{\alpha}^{(c)}$, $C^{(c)}$ and $N^{(+1)}$
\end{itemize}
