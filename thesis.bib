  abstract = {Author Summary Here, we introduce a novel protein contact prediction method PconsC2 that, to the best of our knowledge, outperforms earlier methods. PconsC2 is based on our earlier method, PconsC, as it utilizes the same set of contact predictions from plmDCA and PSICOV. However, in contrast to PconsC, where each residue pair is analysed independently, the initial predictions are analysed in context of neighbouring residue pairs using a deep learning approach, inspired by earlier work. We find that for each layer the deep learning procedure improves the predictions. At the end, after five layers of deep learning and inclusion of a few extra features provides the best performance. An improvement can be seen for all types of proteins, independent on length, number of homologous sequences and structural class. However, the improvement is largest for Î²-sheet containing proteins. Most importantly the improvement brings for the first time sufficiently accurate predictions to some protein families with less than 1000 homologous sequences. PconsC2 outperforms as well state of the art machine learning based predictors for protein families larger than 100 effective sequences.

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction was for decades one of the grand unsolved challenges in bioinformatics. A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximum entropy approach to describe couplings between columns in a multiple sequence alignment it was possible to significantly increase the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For very large protein families with more than 1000 effective sequences the accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins as well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domain families no structure is known, but unfortunately most of these families have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too small for existing contact prediction methods. To extend accurate contact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein families we present PconsC3, an improved method for protein contact predictions that can be used for families with as little as 100 effective sequence members. We estimate that PconsC3 provides accurate contact predictions for up to 4646 Pfam domain families. In addition, PconsC3 outperforms previous methods significantly independent on family size, secondary structure content, contact range, or the number of selected contacts. This improvement translates into improved de-novo prediction of three-dimensional structures. PconsC3 is available as a web server and downloadable version at http://c3.pcons.net.

  abstract="A fundamental problem in molecular biology is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. However, molecular modeling to find the structure is at present intractable and is likely to remain so for some time, hence intermediate steps such as predicting which residues pairs are in contact have been developed. Predicted contact pairs have been used for fold prediction, as an initial condition or constraint for molecular modeling, and as a filter to rank multiple models arising from homology modeling. As contact prediction has advanced it is becoming more common for 3D structure predictors to integrate contact prediction into structure building, as this often gives information that is orthogonal to that produced by other methods. This chapter shows how evolutionary information contained in protein sequences and multiple sequence alignments can be used to predict protein structure, and the state-of-the-art predictors and their methodologies are reviewed.",

  abstract={Motivation: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein 3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual information, taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible. Results: This article presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual information, and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and, thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration.

  abstract="Proteins are large organic compounds made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain (primary structure). Most proteins fold into unique three-dimensional (3D) structures called interchangeably tertiary, folded, or native structures. Discovering the tertiary structure of a protein (Protein Folding Problem) can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and it is one of the most important problems in Bioinformatics. A contact map of a given protein P is a binary matrix M such that Mi,j= 1 iff the physical distance between amino acids i and j in the native structure is less than or equal to a pre-assigned threshold t. The contact map of each protein is a distinctive signature of its folded structure. Predicting the tertiary structure of a protein directly from its primary structure is a very complex and still unsolved problem. An alternative and probably more feasible approach is to predict the contact map of a protein from its primary structure and then to compute the tertiary structure starting from the predicted contact map. This last problem has been recently proven to be NP-Hard [6]. In this paper we give a heuristic method that is able to reconstruct in a few seconds a 3D model that exactly matches the target contact map. We wish to emphasize that our method computes an exact model for the protein independently of the contact map threshold. To our knowledge, our method outperforms all other techniques in the literature [5,10,17,19] both for the quality of the provided solutions and for the running times. Our experimental results are obtained on a non-redundant data set consisting of 1760 proteins which is by far the largest benchmark set used so far. Average running times range from 3 to 15 seconds depending on the contact map threshold and on the size of the protein. Repeated applications of our method (starting from randomly chosen distinct initial solutions) show that the same contact map may admit (depending on the threshold) quite different 3D models. Extensive experimental results show that contact map thresholds ranging from 10 to 18 {\AA}ngstrom allow to reconstruct 3D models that are very similar to the proteins native structure.

We here show that an earlier introduced l2-regularized pseudolikelihood maximization method called plmDCA can be modified as to be easily parallelizable, as well as inherently faster on a single processor, at negligible difference in accuracy.

Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction. An implementation of our multivariate Gaussian approach is available at the website http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/code.},

  abstract={Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

  abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.},

These databases provide functional inference for homologous structures, supply templates for structural prediction experiments, and differentiate between homologs and analogs. The rate of structure determination and deposition has increased dramatically over recent years, overwhelming the ability of current classifications to incorporate all new structures. We have developed a fast and reliable methodology for updating domain databases automatically, and created a revised hierarchy for domain classification that emphasizes evolutionary relationships. By classifying all known structures in our database with continuing automatic updates, we provide an up-to-date alternative to current resources. We illustrate several concepts that guided our classification scheme with examples of homology between domains in ECOD that are not observed in other resources.},

First, target structures were divided into domain-based evaluation units. Target splits were based on the domain organization of available templates as well as the performance of servers on whole targets compared to split target domains. Second, evaluation units were classified into TBM and FM categories using a combination of measures that evaluate prediction quality and template detectability. Generally, target domains with sequence-related templates and good server prediction performance were classified as TBM, whereas targets without sequence-identifiable templates and low server performance were classified as FM. As in previous CASP experiments, the boundaries for classification were blurred due to the presence of significant insertions and deteriorations in the targets with respect to homologous templates, as well as the presence of templates with partial coverage of new folds. The FM category included 45 target domains, which represents an unprecedented number of difficult CASP targets provided for modeling. Proteins 2016; 84(Suppl 1):20â33.

  abstract = {Author Summary Protein contact prediction and contact-assisted folding has made good progress due to direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from deep learning, which has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. Our deep learning method can model complex sequence-structure relationship and high-order correlation (i.e., contact occurrence patterns) and thus, improve contact prediction accuracy greatly. Our test results show that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regardless how many sequence homologs are available for a protein in question. Ab initio folding guided by our predicted contacts may fold many more test proteins than the other contact predictors. Our contact-assisted 3D models also have much better quality than homology models built from the training proteins, especially for membrane proteins. One interesting finding is that even trained mostly with soluble proteins, our method performs very well on membrane proteins. Recent blind CAMEO test confirms that our method can fold large proteins with a new fold and only a small number of sequence homologs.},

  abstract={MOTIVATION: Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional relationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein 3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains challenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole-contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map by using mutual information, taking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods demand for a very large number of sequence homologs for the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically infeasible. RESULTS: This article presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine learning and integer linear programming. The evolutionary restraints are much more informative than mutual information, and the physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and, thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under consideration.

  abstract={MOTIVATION: Recent breakthroughs in protein residue-residue contact prediction have made reliable de novo prediction of protein structures possible. The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict contacts for typical alignments 35-113 times faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a CPU mode that is still 4-14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts for typical protein families can be predicted in 15-60 s on a consumer-grade GPU and 1-6 min on a six-core CPU.

  abstract = {Sequential model-based optimization (also known as Bayesian optimization) is one of the most efficient methods (per function evaluation) of function minimization. This efficiency makes it appropriate for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms that are slow to train. The Hyperopt library provides algorithms and parallelization infrastructure for performing hyperparameter optimization (model selection) in Python. This paper presents an introductory tutorial on the usage of the Hyperopt library, including the description of search spaces, minimization (in serial and parallel), and the analysis of the results collected in the course of minimization. This paper also gives an overview of Hyperopt-Sklearn, a software project that provides automatic algorithm configuration of the Scikit-learn machine learning library. Following Auto-Weka, we take the view that the choice of classifier and even the choice of preprocessing module can be taken together to represent a single large hyperparameter optimization problem. We use Hyperopt to define a search space that encompasses many standard components (e.g. SVM, RF, KNN, PCA, TFIDF) and common patterns of composing them together. We demonstrate, using search algorithms in Hyperopt and standard benchmarking data sets (MNIST, 20-newsgroups, convex shapes), that searching this space is practical and effective. In particular, we improve on best-known scores for the model space for both MNIST and convex shapes. The paper closes with some discussion of ongoing and future work.}

  abstract = {Recently developed maximum entropy methods infer evolutionary constraints on protein function and structure from the millions of protein sequences available in genomic databases. The EVfold web server (at EVfold.org) makes these methods available to predict functional and structural interactions in proteins. The key algorithmic development has been to disentangle direct and indirect residue-residue correlations in large multiple sequence alignments and derive direct residue-residue evolutionary couplings (EVcouplings or ECs). For proteins of unknown structure, distance constraints obtained from evolutionarily couplings between residue pairs are used to de novo predict all-atom 3D structures, often to good accuracy. Given sufficient sequence information in a protein family, this is a major advance toward solving the problem of computing the native 3D fold of proteins from sequence information alone.Availability EVfold server at http://evfold.org/Contact evfoldtest{at}gmail.comDIdirect informationECevolutionary couplingEVevolutionaryMSAmultiple sequence alignmentPLMpseudo-likelihood maximizationPPVpositive predictive value (number of true positives divided by the sum of true and false positives)TM-scoretemplate modeling score},

    abstract="During evolution, structure, and function of proteins are remarkably conserved, whereas amino-acid sequences vary strongly between homologous proteins. Structural conservation constrains sequence variability and forces different residues to coevolve, i.e., to show correlated patterns of amino-acid occurrences. However, residue correlation may result from direct coupling, e.g., by a contact in the folded protein, or be induced indirectly via intermediate residues. To use empirically observed correlations for predicting residue--residue contacts, direct and indirect effects have to be disentangled. Here we present mechanistic details on how to achieve this using a methodology called Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA). DCA has been shown to produce highly accurate estimates of amino-acid pairs that have direct reciprocal constraints in evolution. Specifically, we provide instructions and protocols on how to use the algorithmic implementations of DCA starting from data extraction to predicted-contact visualization in contact maps or representative protein structures.",

    abstract = {ABSTRACT This article is an introduction to the special issue of the journal PROTEINS, dedicated to the tenth Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment to assess the state of the art in protein structure modeling. The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

    abstract = {ABSTRACT Modeling of protein structure from amino acid sequence now plays a major role in structural biology. Here we report new developments and progress from the CASP11 community experiment, assessing the state of the art in structure modeling. Notable points include the following: (1) New methods for predicting three dimensional contacts resulted in a few spectacular template free models in this CASP, whereas models based on sequence homology to proteins with experimental structure continue to be the most accurate. (2) Refinement of initial protein models, primarily using molecular dynamics related approaches, has now advanced to the point where the best methods can consistently (though slightly) improve nearly all models. (3) The use of relatively sparse NMR constraints dramatically improves the accuracy of models, and another type of sparse data, chemical crosslinking, introduced in this CASP, also shows promise for producing better models. (4) A new emphasis on modeling protein complexes, in collaboration with CAPRI, has produced interesting results, but also shows the need for more focus on this area. (5) Methods for estimating the accuracy of models have advanced to the point where they are of considerable practical use. (6) A first assessment demonstrates that models can sometimes successfully address biological questions that motivate experimental structure determination. (7) There is continuing progress in accuracy of modeling regions of structure not directly available by comparative modeling, while there is marginal or no progress in some other areas.
